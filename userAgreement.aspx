        <strong>Possible Risks:p>
        <strong>Possible Risks:</sAs with any medical or mental health care, there are potential risks associated with the use of <em>

        These risks include, but may not be
        limited to, the following:
    </p><ol>

        <li>
            <p>
                • In some cases, applicable law may prevent Your Health Professional from providing the services You
                desire.
                          desire.
            </p>

            <p>
                • In some cases, Your Health Professional may conclude that the information transmitted is not
                sufficient (e.g. poor resolution of images), or on some
                other basis the nature of Your problem is such that it does not allow for appropriate medical or
                mental
                health decision-making without an in-person
                evaluation;
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                • Delays in medical or mental health evaluation/treatment could occur owing to deficiencies or
                failures
                of the electronic equipment or of the electric
                power needed to run it;

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>

                information;
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>• The physical examination Your Health Professional can perform through <em>
                PrimeDoc</em> is
                necessarily more limited than that which is possible in
                in-person care, so information that can be obtained only by means of an in-person physical
                examination
                will not be available to permit diagnosis. This
                could result in misdiagnosis, which in turn could lead to treatment that is not helpful, or that
                could
                even be harmful.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                • In some cases, a lack of access to Your complete medical or mental health records may increase the
                risk of misdiagnosis, adverse drug interactions,
                allergic reactions or other unintended results.

            </p>

                risks,
                including potentially serious risks, that cannot be
                mentioned here because they have not yet been identified.
