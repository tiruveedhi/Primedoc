                                As a general rule, <i>PrimeDoc</i>
                                does not collect information pertinent to
                                the services Health Professionals provide, either educational information to Consumers
                                or clinical services to Patients. Other than information needed for administration
                                of Our service, <i>PrimeDoc</i>
                                does not seek to collect individually identifiable
                                health information as defined at 45 CFR §160.103.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At Your request, however, and only at Your request, <i>PrimeDoc</i>
                                will store
                                protected health information (“PHI”) as defined at 45 C.F.R. § 160.103, for Your
                                use and, at Your election, your Health Professionals’ use. You have the option to
                                upload or not to upload PHI, but if You do, You will have access to Your own PHI.
                                We also offer an optional anonymous mode to further protect Patient identity. No
                                PHI is required to use <i>PrimeDoc</i>.</p>

                                PHI provided to <i>PrimeDoc</i>
                                and transmitted between or among mobile devices,
                                the <i>Prime Doc</i>
                                website, and its servers is encrypted. The passwords that
                                allow access to the <i>PrimeDoc</i>
                                App and website, which may contain PHI,
                                are also encrypted. The <i>PrimeDoc</i>
                                server that PHI may be stored on is
                                protected by a firewall. Human access is limited to that access needed to maintain
                                the server, and excludes access to PHI. <i>PrimeDoc</i>
                                servers require secure
                                shell certificates for access. The servers have all ports closed (deny-all mode)
                                except for a few that remain open because they are vital for <i>PrimeDoc</i>
                                to operate. These are secured with authentication (login/password) and encryption
                                (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure/ Secure Socket Layer (“HTTPS/SSL”) traffic.
                                <i>PrimeDoc</i>
                                undertakes reasonable efforts to secure all PHI it is sent.
                                In the event of a hacker attack, however, it is always possible, despite deployment
                                of reasonable safeguards, that PHI may be exposed. By using <i>PrimeDoc</i>,
                                You accept this risk of unauthorized PHI use or disclosure.</p>

                                to help identify problems with Our servers, to gather de-identified demographic

                                or legal proceedings, including, for example, in response to subpoenas, search warrants,
                                court orders, or other legal process.</p>

                                are subject
                                to laws governing the privacy of medical records. Any individually identifiable
                                health information provided to <i>PrimeDoc </i>
                                by a Health Professional is
                                subject to or protected by law. To the extent the law applies to <i>PrimeDoc</i>,
                                We will make reasonable efforts to maintain the privacy of Your health information.

                                infiltration or attacks. Some attacks are easier to identify than others. Distributed
                                denial-of-service (“DDos”) attacks, or Brute-force attacks, for example, are much
                                easier to identify than attacks in which someone mimics a user and steals a username
                                and password. Consumers or Patients electing to store PHI on <i>PrimeDoc</i>
                                accept responsibility for securing their usernames and passwords. Should We become
                                aware of a compromise of PHI, We shall notify the relevant Health Professionals
                                as soon as possible but in any event within thirty (30) days of learning of that
                                compromise.</p>
